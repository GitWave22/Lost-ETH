# Lost-ETH
Compilation of Ethereum typos, user errors, and buggy contracts; Goal of categorizing all of the ETH supply forever out of market circulation 

As of November 2023, I have categorized 909,800 ETH worth $1.73B+ that are lost forever: 0.6%+ of all circulating supply. Please see the CSV file for breakdown of details and categories. 

Addresses were sourced from a variety of public reports and queries. Special thanks to  @tayvano_ and @j6sp5r

If you haven't seen it already, Johannes did a great set of research scanning for typos which I incorporated: https://media.consensys.net/over-12-000-ether-are-lost-forever-due-to-typos-f6ccc35432f8
